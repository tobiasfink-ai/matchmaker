model is not viable, some sell your data to finance themselves.\\nIntego\\nVirus Barrier\\n© Lemon Press.net\\nThis antivirus comparator will help you find the right solution that effectively meets your security needs, regardless of your device.\\nIn the list, all antivirus are compatible with Windows.\\nIntego which has long been the great reference on Mac (exclusively) has launched an antivirus on Windows of very high quality.\\nIt is not compatible with iOS or Android.\\nIn 2022, it is advisable to install an antivirus as soon as possible to protect against Internet threats on all

associated prices are sometimes for antivirus alone and sometimes for a complete security suite.\\nAs you can imagine, a free antivirus is not the right solution to address security.\\nIn this case, there is always a quid pro quo and most often it is your personal data.\\nIt is therefore better to agree to pay a small subscription of a few euros a month for software that will assure you of the seriousness and economic model of the company behind the antivirus.\\nBitdefender, Intego or McAfee\\nare all reliable partners you can trust\\n.\\nAntivirus\\nIf you haven’t yet subscribed to a good, effective antivirus, it’s no big deal: not only do antiviruses do prevention, but they also, as a bonus, identify and clean up viruses already present on an infected device – before quarantining any malware it detects.\\nThis applies equally to computers\\nto tablets, smartphones or any other connected devices.\\nThe best advice is to assume that everything that connects to the Internet can be the victim of computer attacks.\\nOnce you have installed the antivirus software, you will need to do a complete analysis of all the files on your computer to find the files, programs, and other pieces of malicious code and quarantine them (that is, separate them from the others so that they do not infect them).\\nThis is all the more crucial if your computer is a bit old and slow – which can be a sign of malware.\\nOnce this task is done, the best antivirus you can find in this comparison will then do prevention by alerting you to any sensitive files discovered on your computer.\\nIt can analyze your PC in depth as well as your other connected objects such as smartphones, fridges or tablets.\\nTop 5 best\\nantivirus 2022: Bitdefender Total\\nSecurity\\nFree UST, CCCT, LDCT, GPT, MT,

      "[\"Best antivirus 2022: which antivirus to choose for Windows 11 and 10?\\n– Le Crabe Info Le Crabe 01/10/21: update of antivirus ranking with latest AV-Comparatives tests.\\nWhat is the best antivirus in 2022?\\nWhich antivirus to choose for Windows 11 or Windows 10?\\nAntivirus free or paid?\\nHere are all the questions you have when choosing the security software you need for a Windows PC: antivirus.\\nWith all the offers available on the market, it is sometimes difficult to make a choice and know which antivirus to choose.\\nAnd by installing the wrong antivirus, your computer may be compromised and infected with viruses and malware.\\nIn this article, we will look at how to choose a good antivirus, the right antivirus and the best antivirus for Windows PC based on the results of tests conducted by independent organizations.\\nExecutive Summary\\nWhy do I need to install an antivirus?\\nAn antivirus protects a computer from viruses and malware that thrive on the Internet.\\nIts goal is to detect and neutralize viruses before they enter and contaminate the system.\\nIt’s THE security software you need to install, especially on a Windows PC.\\nIndeed, since Windows is by far the most popular operating system, it is the No. 1 target of hackers and their viruses.\\nAntivirus is all the more essential as the threats multiply and diversify: Trojan horses, rootkits, ransomwares, etc.\\nToday we talk about malware (malware) to qualify all computer threats (of which viruses are a part).\\nAnti-virus software has adapted and is now able to protect computers from all types of malware.\\nThey no longer just eradicate viruses: they act as antivirus but also as anti-trojans, anti-rootkits, anti-ransomwares…\\nThey are now anti-malware, although many retain their appellation of origin\\n“Antivirus”, more commercial.\\nChoosing your antivirus\\nThe Criteria for Properly Choosing Antivirus For an antivirus to be considered good, it must meet several criteria: it must be effective in detecting and removing viruses: the software’s anti-virus engine must be capable of detecting known viruses and alerting you when a suspicious action occurs on the system.\\nThey must also be able to remove or quarantine the viruses they have detected.\\nIts viral database must also be up to date with the latest known threats.\\nLittle impact on system performance: since anti-virus software must constantly monitor the system, it must use system resources (CPU, RAM).\\nA good antivirus doesn't need to eat all these resources or it will slow down Windows and make your computer difficult to use.\\nLittle false positive detection: a false positive is a detection error where the antivirus believes that a file is malicious when it is healthy.\\nA good antivirus must know how to detect real threats as much as possible.\\nIt should not alert you for nothing or worse delete/quarantine healthy personal or system files.\\nEasy to use: a good antivirus must have an intuitive, easy-to-use interface in which it is easy to access the various functionalities.\\nThe user needs to understand what the antivirus does, an integrated manual or informative bubbles are a plus.\\nAntivirus free or paid?\\nFree and paid antivirus offer the same level of protection from viruses and malware.\\nThere are, however, three important differences between free and paid antivirus: The confidentiality of the user’s personal data.\\nProtection features.\\n> Confidentiality To finance the development and in return for free antivirus software, some publishers collect data on their users for resale to companies.\\nYes, when it’s free, it’s your product.\\nRecently, it was Avast Software – the publisher of Avast and AVG antivirus software – that made the news.\\nIt has been reported that the publisher has been collecting the web browsing data of their users for years.\\nOnly users of the free version of Avast and AVG are affected by this commercial exploitation of their data.\\nOn the paid version, no data is collected.\\nAvast Free Data Collection\\nAntivirus\\nWhile users have always had the option to opt out of sharing their data, this required digging into the software options.\\nGood point, Avast Software has recently implemented an explicit opt-in or opt-out option on data collection when installing free versions of Avast and AVG.\\nAvast and AVG are not isolated cases; other free antivirus software does the same.\\nTo sum up: with free antivirus, your personal data is collected and sold.\\nWith a paid antivirus, no data collection is done.\\n> Functionality\\nPaid antiviruses have more security-related features than their free counterparts.\\nConsider the Avast antivirus: Avast\\nFree\\nAntivirus (the free version) blocks viruses and other malware, detects network vulnerabilities and has a password manager.\\nAvast\\nPremium\\nSecurity (the paid version)\\nhas the same features + protects against DNS hacking, integrates a sandbox, blocks unwanted e-mails, integrates an advanced firewall, blocks ransomwares, integrates an automatic application update tool …\\nAvast:\\nfree vs. paid antivirus As you can see, paid antivirus protects computers on many fronts while free antivirus does the minimum.\\nEven so, the level of protection from malware between a free and a paid antivirus is identical.\\n>\\nAdvertising Unlike paid antiviruses, free antiviruses display advertising in Windows.\\nMost often, they are advertisements related to the publisher’s products.\\nGTA ads\\nAntivirus\\nDepending on your tolerance for advertising\\n, the choice of a paid antivirus can be synonymous with tranquillity.\\nWhich solution : Antivirus, Internet Security, Total Security… ?\\nAnti-virus software is available in several versions.\\nMost of the time there is a free version and several paid versions.\\nFor example, at Kaspersky Lab, four versions of Kaspersky antivirus are available: Kaspersky Anti-Virus (free);\\nKaspersky Internet\\nSecurity (\\npayant – €);\\nKaspersky Total\\nSecurity (\\npayant – €€);\\nKaspersky Security Cloud (paying - €€).\\nKaspersky Antivirus Solutions The choice of one version over another will depend on the areas where you need to be protected.\\nDepending on the version chosen, in addition to the anti-virus module (which protects malicious software and websites), you will have access to: protection against malicious e-mails (spam, phishing…);\\nan advanced firewall that blocks all programs that have not been explicitly allowed to communicate over the Internet, thus preventing malware from downloading malicious content.\\nUnlike the Windows firewall, it automatically blocks outgoing connections.\\na sandbox which allows software to be run in a secure environment without the risk of it infecting the system;\\n… The aggregation of all these modules forms what is known as a security suite, often referred to by antivirus publishers as Internet Security, Total Security or Premium Security.\\nWhat is the BEST antivirus?\\nThe answer is simple: there is no better antivirus.\\nOf all the antiviruses available, none are waterproof.\\nViruses and other malware mutate, evolve constantly and always have a head start.\\nIt is always up to antivirus to adapt to new threats that do damage before antivirus publishers find solutions to block them and users update their antivirus software.\\nAll antivirus publishers\\nThere is no better\\nantivirus”, the holy grail so much sought by many Internet users.\\nEach antivirus has its strengths and weaknesses, they are all more or less effective in detecting a certain type of malware, the ability to neutralize them, to block malicious websites, to have a measured impact on the performance of the system…\\nThere is no one antivirus that beats all others.\\nThere are only antiviruses better than others in some areas.\\nWindows Defender\\nIf you are on Windows 11 or Windows 10, be aware that this one includes natively an antivirus made in Microsoft: Windows Defender.\\nWindows Defender\\nAntivirus\\nin Windows 10\\nAccording to tests conducted by AV-Comparatives, Windows Defender obtains\\ngood results in detecting and suppressing viruses and other malware\\n.\\nHowever, it has a fairly high false post detection rate and can have a negative impact on the performance of the system: it is indeed rather handicapping when copying files (so be careful if you make regular backups) and when performing ZIP archive compression/decompression processes.\\nSo you can do with it to protect your PC from viruses.\\nUsing another free antivirus such as Avast\\nFree\\nAntivirus can be useful to you (it scores higher in virus detection/suppression, false positives and performance)\\nif you need it.\\nExpectation\\n\\n\"]\n",
